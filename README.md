# Captcha-Recognisation

I made this during an event of my college.
It is a captcha recognisation which is trained on Emnist Balanced dataset.
I also added Gui feature on this model to make it easy to take image from gallery and camera and predict the captcha.

# How to run

The model is names as new_emnist_model.sav. you have to only run "gui_for_captcha.py" to run the code.
